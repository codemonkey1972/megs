The Martial Artist may only substitute his APs of Skill for one of these values each phase and must declare for which value (if any) he will substitute during the upcoming phase. Substitutions of this nature only affect hand-to-hand combat and attacks made with melee weapons (knives, swords, staves, etc.).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Example: A Martial Artist who had chosen to substitute APs of Skill for his RV is attacked by an Energy Blast; since this attack is neither hand-to-hand nor melee combat, he would defend with his normal RV, not with the APs of Martial Artist. Similarly, if the Martial Artist was planning to fire an Energy Blast during the upcoming phase, he could not use his APs of Skill as the AV or EV of the attack.</p>\n<p>Note: A Character substituting Martial Artist APs for any value can only spend a number of Hero Points equal to his substituted Attribute value on the attempt. For example, if the Batman (STR of 5 APs, and Martial Artist of 9 APs) were to substitute his APs of Martial Artist for his EV, he could spend a maximum of 5 Hero Points on his EV, as this figure was the AP level of his substituted Attribute (STR).</p>",
